.SH NAME
rcsshow \- show RCS log interspersed with changes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.hc %
.B "%rcsshow"

.SH WHERE
.B "%rcsshow"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
After removing apparent options
.B "%rcsshow"
assumes all other parameters are file names to be passed to
.BR rlog .
.PP
For each given file,
.B "%rcsshow"
shows its
.I rlog
output in chronological order, interspersed with the
.I rcsdiff
output corresponding to the revision.
.PP
Options beginning with 
.I -r
are assumed to be for
.I rlog
while any other options are given
to
.IR rcsdiff .
.PP
Chronological order, as opposed to reverse chronological order,
seems to be a big win.
.SH EXAMPLES

.\" Example 1
.RS

.ne 3
rcsshow -r1.209: -U3 CLASSES/Tutors
.RE
.fi

.PP
That will show, in chronological order, all revisions from
.I 1.209
on in unified diff format with 3 lines of context.

.ne 3
rcsshow -r1.209:1.210 -U100000 CLASSES/Tutors
.RE
.fi
.sp
.PP
That will (unless the file is more than 100,000 lines) show the entire
file with changes corresponding to the given revision
indicated in unified diff format.

output.

rcsshow -r [filename]...
.RE

.PP
Produces no output, whereas  one might expect it to show
the
.B rlog
entry for the latest revision, and the
.B rcsdiff
output with the "previous" release.
.PP
In general, one fewer revision is shown in the output than might be expected.
