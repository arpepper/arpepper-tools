It seems that on the originating host
%(cs-xh-admin.cs.uwaterloo.ca)
if you specify the "-H" option, intending to obtain HTML output, it does
not work.
It appears that insufficient
.B man
and (more specifically)
.B groff
packages have been installed to produce such output.
Most pages should format to HTML sufficiently if transferred to some system
where %"man\ -l\ -Hcat" works.
