.SH NAME
codall \- recursively show all checked-out (co'd) files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.hc %
.B "%codall"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B codall
recursively searches beneath the current directory
for any RCS files which are in checked-out state, and lists
the corresponding working-files for each.
.SH EXAMPLES
.\".PP
.\" Example 1
.RS
.nf
.ft CW
.ne 3
codall
.RE
.fi
.sp
.PP
Might produce something like
.sp
.nf
.ft CW
.RS
.ne 3
 \./bin/xh-clone-pkg
 \./bin/rcsdstar
 \./proj-cs-xh-admin/renumbering-20120417/allmaps
 \./proj-cs-xh-admin/RT1148152-isaS21/README
 \./.software/arch/mailtools-arp-2.0/servers/mailman-url-dump
.RE
.fi
.sp
.SH SEE ALSO
.\" 
.B codstar
\- recursively show checked-out (co'd) files
.RS
.PP
That related command
.BR codstar ,
produces similar results,
but will not seach
"dot-files" (and "dot-directories").
in the current directory.
.sp
.RE
.B rlog
\- print log messages and other information about RCS files
.br
.B sed
\- stream editor for filtering and transforming text
.RE
.B find
\- search for files in a directory hierarchy
.br
.br
.sp
.SH NOTE
.PP
Fundamentally,
.B codall
runs
.\" Example
.RS
.nf
.ft CW
.ne 3
rlog -L -R filename
.RE
.fi
.sp
.PP
on each RCS file found, and then,
using
.BR sed ,
transforms the output into the
(probable) working file name.
.SH BUGS
.PP
Conceivably, the transformation to working file name will occasionally go wrong.
.PP
If there are a lot of "dot-directories" immediately beneath the
current working directory,
.B codall
can take a long time to run, and perhaps produce unwanted results.
