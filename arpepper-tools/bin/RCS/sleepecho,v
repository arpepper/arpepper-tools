@sleep for optional first argument (requires a dash as well as being
numeric), after echoing any further arguments.
 
It would seem there should be a standard command like this, or that
one or both of sleep or echo would have grown the functionality.

A place this is useful is for giving to commands e.g. xterm, which
want to do an exec based on the args you give them.  Arranging to have
multiple commands executed can be difficult.
